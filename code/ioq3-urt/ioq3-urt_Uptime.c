	Earliest point this can  be for an auto-run, is right after Com_ExecuteCfg() in Com_Init().

	uint32_t and strtoul() are used (working as intented in most systems) for 136.2 years of recording in seconds.
	64bit support would be possible but a mess of #ifdefs since the printing and saving methods to do it
	aren't standardized across systems and their 32 and 64 bit versions.

	TODO: Server support. Difficulty may arise for multiple server support. This is already a quirk on client.
