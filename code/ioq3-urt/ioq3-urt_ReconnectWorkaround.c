	Workaround the 'server is full->server is for low pings' behavior plus false positives of 'server is for low pings'.
	We don't actually 'hijack the proper way' since assessing a connection with a single ping wasn't proper anyway. 
	e.g. The first one is often unrealistically high.
	A further workround in CL_Connect_f avoids console closing down each explicit reconnect; done_reconnect counter
	(used to not flood legitimate high ping denial) is global (static in nature) to allow for resetting it on same session. 
	NOTE: perhaps a type of waiting (before reconnect_f and no counter).
	Added: clu.done_reconnect is reset when explicitely /reconnect'ing with [the addition of] CL_Reconnect_f_clu
